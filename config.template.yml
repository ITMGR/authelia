# Default redirection URL
#
# If user tries to authenticate without any referer, Authelia
# does not know where to redirect the user to at the end of the
# authentication process.
# This parameter allows you to specify the default redirection
# URL Authelia will use in such a case.
#
# Note: this parameter is optional. If not provided, user won't
# be redirected upon successful authentication.

# The authentication backend to use for verifying user passwords
# and retrieve information such as email address and groups
# users belong to.
#
# There are two supported backends: `ldap` and `file`.
authentication_backend:
  # LDAP backend configuration.
  #
  # This backend allows Authelia to be scaled to more
  # than one instance and therefore is recommended for
  # production.
  ldap:
    # The url of the ldap server
    url: ldap://openldap

    # An additional dn to define the scope of groups
    additional_groups_dn: ou=groups

    # The groups filter used for retrieving groups of a given user.
    # {0} is a matcher replaced by username.
    # {dn} is a matcher replaced by user DN.
    # 'member={dn}' by default.

  # File backend configuration.
  #
  # With this backend, the users database is stored in a file
  # which is updated when users reset their passwords.
  # Therefore, this backend is meant to be used in a dev environment
  # and not in production since it prevents Authelia to be scaled to
  # more than one instance.

# Access Control
#
# Access control is a set of rules you can use to restrict user access to certain 
# resources.
# Any (apply to anyone), per-user or per-group rules can be defined.
#
# If 'access_control' is not defined, ACL rules are disabled and the `allow` default 
# policy is applied, i.e., access is allowed to anyone. Otherwise restrictions follow 
# the rules defined.
# 
# Note: One can use the wildcard * to match any subdomain. 
# It must stand at the beginning of the pattern. (example: *.mydomain.com)
# 
# Note: You must put the pattern in simple quotes when using the wildcard for the YAML
# to be syntactically correct.
#
# Definition: A `rule` is an object with the following keys: `domain`, `policy` 
# and `resources`.
# - `domain` defines which domain or set of domains the rule applies to.
# - `policy` is the policy to apply to resources. It must be either `allow` or `deny`.
# - `resources` is a list of regular expressions that matches a set of resources to 
# apply the policy to.
#
# Note: Rules follow an order of priority defined as follows:
# In each category (`any`, `groups`, `users`), the latest rules have the highest 
# priority. In other words, it means that if a given resource matches two rules in the
# same category, the latest one overrides the first one.
# Each category has also its own priority. That is, `users` has the highest priority, then
# `groups` and `any` has the lowest priority. It means if two rules in different categories
# match a given resource, the one in the category with the highest priority overrides the
# other one.
#
access_control:
  # Default policy can either be `allow` or `deny`.
  # It is the policy applied to any resource if it has not been overridden
  # in the `any`, `groups` or `users` category.
